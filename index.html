	<p> 
		With different AI image generators imerging in this past year, most notably AI image generators <i>Dall-E 2, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion,</i> AI is smarter, better, and easier to use then ever before. The jump of AI performance from 2019 to 2022 is <b>massive</b>. Today you can search up "AI image generators" and within 5 minutes be ready to start making whatever images your mind can imagine. All thats required is a prompt, some clever thinking, and a bit of time to mess around with the various settings the AI gives you, and you can have any image to a certain extent. The more detailed and descriptive words you give the AI the higher the chance it will make exactly what you tell it to.
