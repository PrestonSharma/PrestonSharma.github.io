		<h2>AI and where it stands</h2>

		  <p>
		<h3>AI has evolved and stepped up its game recently and has become alot more popular and recognized now having multiple ways for the ordinary person to use it, in just the past year AI image generation has gotten 5x better. AI has been putting people out of jobs in factorys for 45 years, but now its coming for artists, and its coming fast.</h3>

	<p> 
		With different AI image generators imerging in this past year, most notably AI image generators <i>Dall-E 2, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion,</i> AI is smarter, better, and easier to use then ever before. The jump of AI performance from 2019 to 2022 is <b>massive</b>. Today you can search up "AI image generators" and within 5 minutes be ready to start making whatever images your mind can imagine. All thats required is a prompt, some clever thinking, and a bit of time to mess around with the various settings the AI gives you, and you can have any image to a certain extent. The more detailed and descriptive words you give the AI the higher the chance it will make exactly what you tell it to.

		How can we stop this AI? You may not even want to, but even if you do, you cant. Thats the truth, AI is still evolving and learns more everyday through adaptive programs and machine learning. "If you cant beat em, might as well join em." Many people hypothasize that in the future the most profitable job will be working with AI and this kind of tech stuff thats really starting to emerge in our lives.
		
		<h3> But the real question is what do <u>you</u> think? Do you support the devolopment of Artifical Intelligence and want to help it grow? Or do you think that it should'nt grow and you dont want it to replace artists and workers? Because if AI continues on this path it will take many more jobs in the <i>near future</i>. In the <u> very near </u>future. So be ready, because AI is coming fast, faster than you can ever imagine.</h3>
